/**
 * What the koi is allowed to notice.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE: every message is computed from the existing truth sources —
 * lib/dev/universe.ts, lib/now.ts, lib/dev/lab.ts. Nothing here restates a
 * status in its own words. If a product's stage changes, the koi's line changes
 * with it, because the line was never a separate copy of the fact.
 *
 * The studio's companion learned this the hard way and documented the failure
 * mode as "a shadow website that goes stale". A companion that describes the
 * site from memory is a second source of truth, and second sources drift.
 *
 * Corollary: when there is nothing verified to say, the koi says nothing.
 * Silence is a valid state and is used deliberately.
