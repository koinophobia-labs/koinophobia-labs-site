AI workflows are scoped after discovery because the number of tools, rules, and failure paths varies. Final scope and price are approved before development." },
  { question: "How quickly can you start?", answer: "Availability is confirmed after the initial intake. A start date is not promised until scope, required content, access, and any applicable initial payment are ready." },
  { question: "How long does a project take?", answer: "Quick fixes typically take 1–3 business days, landing pages 3–7 business days, websites 1–3 weeks, and AI workflows 1–4 weeks. The approved scope includes the actual schedule." },
  { question: "Do I need a completely new website?", answer: "No. If the foundation is sound, a focused repair or landing-page rebuild may be the better investment. The audit exists to make that decision clearer." },
  { question: "Can you improve my current site?", answer: "Yes. Koinophobia Labs can repair calls to action, forms, mobile layouts, conversion copy, analytics basics, and booking paths without replacing everything." },
  { question: "Can you connect forms, calendars, payments, or email?", answer: "Yes, when the tools support reliable integration. The exact data flow, third-party costs, permissions, and fallback behavior are documented during scoping." },
  { question: "Do you offer ongoing maintenance?", answer: "Maintenance can be scoped separately. It is optional unless the system genuinely requires ongoing operation or third-party monitoring." },
  { question: "What happens after I submit an inquiry?", answer: "Blake reviews the business problem, fit, budget, and timeline, then replies with the smallest sensible next step. That may be an audit, a focused estimate, or an honest recommendation not to build yet." },
  { question: "What does the audit include?", answer: "The $250 Revenue Leak Audit reviews the customer journey, mobile experience, content clarity, contact and booking paths, accessibility, SEO, performance, broken links, and security basics. You receive a prioritized PDF and walkthrough." },
  { question: "Do you work with businesses outside Chicago?", answer: "Yes. The studio is based in Chicago and can work remotely with businesses elsewhere when the project and communication needs are a good fit." },

  { question: "What if I am not sure what I need?", answer: "Use the AI Project Concierge to describe the friction in plain language and get a preliminary, rules-grounded recommendation.
