 * The koi journey — the single source of truth for the scroll-state map.

 * with a sticky reading stage inside it, so local progress `t` runs 0 -> 1 as
 * the band passes the viewport:
 *
 *   t 0.00 .. ARRIVE_END   the koi decelerates in, copy settles
 *   t ARRIVE_END .. DEPART_START   HOLD. Copy is static and readable.
 *   t DEPART_START .. 1.00 the koi accelerates out, copy recedes
 *
 * Nothing here hijacks scrolling. Everything is a pure function of scroll
 * position, so reverse scrolling, keyboard paging, deep links, refresh at any
 * offset and browser back/forward all behave identically.
