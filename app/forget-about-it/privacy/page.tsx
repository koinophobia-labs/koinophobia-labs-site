      <section>
        <h2>The short version</h2>
        <p>
          ForgetAboutIt is a private memory journal from Koinophobia Labs. Every
          thought you capture stays on your iPhone and Apple Watch. The app has no
          account system, no analytics, and no server of its own — it contains no
          networking code at all. Koinophobia Labs never receives, stores, or sees
          anything you capture.

        <h2>What stays on your devices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Captured thoughts.</strong> The words you speak or type, when
            you captured them, and which device they came from are stored in a
            local database on your iPhone. Thoughts captured on the Watch queue
            locally and transfer to your iPhone over Apple&apos;s private
            device-to-device connection (WatchConnectivity); they do not travel
            through the internet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Everything derived from them.</strong> The daily story,
            recognised names and subjects, open-loop suggestions, and statistics
            are computed on your device from your own words and stored beside
            them. Nothing is sent to any AI service or other external provider.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preferences.</strong> Your onboarding answers, confirmation
            style, and reminder settings are stored on the device.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The journal database is excluded from iCloud and computer backups as a
          deliberate privacy choice. That also means a new phone starts empty and
          a lost phone takes its journal with it — use{" "}
          <strong>Settings → Save a copy of everything</strong> in the app to save an export
          you control.

        <h2>What the app never collects</h2>
        <p>
          ForgetAboutIt has no accounts, no sign-in, no analytics or crash SDKs,
          no advertising, no tracking, and no third-party AI processing. It does
          not collect names, email addresses, locations, identifiers, usage data,
          or diagnostics. Because the app makes no network requests, no data can
          leave your device through it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Speech and dictation</h2>
        <p>
          On iPhone, spoken capture uses Apple&apos;s on-device speech
          recognition; audio is transcribed on the phone and never stored. On
          Apple Watch, dictation is provided by watchOS itself and hands the app
          text only — depending on your device, language, and settings, Apple may
          process dictation audio on device or on Apple&apos;s servers under
          Apple&apos;s own privacy terms. The app never records or retains audio
          on either device.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>
          The optional evening reminder is scheduled locally on your iPhone. Its
          text never includes what you captured — or even how much. Reminder-style
          thoughts with an explicit time can schedule a local notification; its
          content is generic. No notification passes through a remote service.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Deleting your data</h2>
        <p>
          Delete any thought inside the app — deletions offer a brief undo, then
          are removed permanently. <strong>Settings → Erase everything</strong> erases
          the entire journal. Removing the app from your devices removes all of
          its data with it, because nothing exists anywhere else.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>These web pages</h2>
        <p>
          The ForgetAboutIt pages on this site are hosted by Vercel, whose
          infrastructure can process technical data such as IP address, request
          time, and browser type to serve the pages. The app itself never talks
          to this website.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Support messages</h2>
        <p>
          If you email support, Koinophobia Labs processes the address and
          information you include in order to respond. Google provides Gmail,
          which processes those messages.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
          ForgetAboutIt is a general-audience journal and is not directed to
          children. It collects no personal information from anyone.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          Koinophobia Labs may update this policy if the app changes. The
          effective date above identifies the current version.
